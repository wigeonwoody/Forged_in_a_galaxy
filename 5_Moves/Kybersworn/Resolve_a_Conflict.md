# Resolve a Conflict
Progress Move

When **you progress an ongoing conflict** by fulfilling a vow in service to its resolution, you may attempt to end the conflict, even if you are far away from the conflict's battlefield. If you do so...

- By providing one or both sides with a McGuffin, roll +edge.
- By convincing the leader of a faction with which you are bonded to withdraw their troops, roll +heart.
- Through combat, bloodshed, or threatening action, roll +iron.
- With manipulation or guile, roll +shadow.
- By brokering a deal between the two factions, roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, add +2 progress to this conflict.

On a **weak hit**, add +1 progress.

On a ***miss***, [[Pay_the_Price]].

If ***you mark progress***, roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress of this conflict. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a ***strong hit***, you find a resolution, and the conflict is over. Both factions withdraw their troops or agree to a ceasefire ([[Ask_the_Oracle]] if you are unsure).

On a ***weak hit***, the conflict continues. Choose one.
- Peace is upon us: Take +2 momentum.
- You are resilient: Take +1 spirit.
- Your victory provides a new perspective: You learn something new about the conflict, or are joined by an ally. Consult the Oracle.
- You have a plan: [[Swear_an_Iron_Vow]] to resolve a dispute or cripple an enemy faction, with a rank of formidable or higher.

On a ***miss***, the conflict continues, and you are punished for pursuing progress. [[Pay_the_Price]].
