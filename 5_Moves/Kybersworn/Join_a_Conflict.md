# Join a Conflict

When **you enter into a battle with many combatants**, or **show your support for an emissary seeking help in battle**, decide which faction to aid and then set the rank of the conflict.

- If you can see beyond the battle, or the melee is contained to a single area or building, then the rank is Troublesome. (Mark three boxes per progress.)
- If you cannot see where the battle ends, or the melee encompasses the entire local area, then the rank is Dangerous. (Mark two box per progress.)
- If the engagement stretches to the horizon, or you can see the flash of lightsabers on the battlefield, then the rank is Formidable. (Mark one ticks per progress.)
- If one or more factions have air support, including at least rank is Extreme. (Mark two ticks per progress.)
- If the entire star system is part of the conflict and there are multiple capital ships, or if the Death Star is present, then the rank is Epic. (Mark one tick per progress.)

Then, roll +spirit. If you are bonded with the faction you have chosen to help, add +1. If your chosen faction has suffered losses or is at a disadvantage, subtract -2.

On a **strong hit**, choose two.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.
- Make a plan: add +2 if you [[Gather_Information]] immediately.
- Secure the area: take +2 momentum.
- Prepare to act: take Initiative. (You are in control.)
- Take command: add +1 if you [[Push_Forward]] immediately.

On a **miss**, you are caught up in the chaos of battle. [[Pay_the_Price]] or [[Battle]] in order to regain initiative.

You can only leave the battlefield by making a [[Fall_Back]] move.
