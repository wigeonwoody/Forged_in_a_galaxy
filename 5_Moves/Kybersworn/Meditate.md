# Meditate

When you ***kneel and reach out to the Force for at least several minutes***, roll +heart. If you are a follower of the dark side, roll +shadow instead. If you score a ***strong hit***, choose two. On a ***weak hit***, choose one. On a ***miss***, you must add +1 conflict or [[Endure_Stress]].

- Take +1 spirit.
- Take +2 momentum.
- Take -1 conflict.
- If your next move is [[Gather_Information]] to gain insight into your current task or discover what you need to do next, add +1.
- If you are joined by the ghost of a fallen master, envision their teachings and take +1 spirit or -1 conflict.
