# Push Forward

When **you move toward a target or objective** in a conflict with many combatants, envision your action and roll. If you act...

- In defense of someone with whom you share a bond, roll +heart.
- By charging ahead, or inside the belly of a heavily armored vehicle, roll +iron.
- With agility and finesse, or by riding a speedy vehicle, roll +edge.
- With trickery or in secrecy, roll +shadow.
- Alone against impossible odds, roll +spirit, then take -1 spirit.
- By utilizing the resources at your disposal, roll +supply, then take -1 supply.

On a **strong hit**, you assume a new position closer to your opponent. Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you reach your new position, but [[Clash]] against blaster fire.

On a **miss**, you are interrupted and [[Pay_the_Price]].
