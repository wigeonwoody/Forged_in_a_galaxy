# Lift Off

When **you board a ship headed for a distant location**, envision the vehicle's current position.
- If the landing zone is not safe, roll +iron.
- If the ship is already airbone when you board, roll +edge.
- If you lift off in secrecy, roll +shadow.
- If you are bonded with a droid onboard or embarking from a community with which you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, you achieve lift off without complications.
On a **weak hit**, you lift off, but suffer -1 supply.
On a **miss**, you are confronted by an enemy or refuse passage, and you must [[Swear_an_Iron_Vow]] ranked Troublesome to resolve the dispute.
