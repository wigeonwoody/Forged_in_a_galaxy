# Land Aircraft

When **you are aboard a ship that is about to land**, envision the landing zone. If you...
- Are in the hands of a trained pilot, and the landing zone is safe, score a strong hit without rolling.
- Have a functional Astromech droid to assist with landing procedures, roll +wits.
- Defend the landing zone by providing cover-fire with a ranged or mounted weapon, roll +iron.
- Are coming in hot, or the pilot is not trained, roll +spirit, but count a strong hit as a weak hit.

On a **strong hit**, the ship lands safely. If you [[Undertake_an_Expedition]] now, add +1 to your roll.

On a **weak hit**, the ship manages to land, but you must [[Face Danger]].

On a **miss**, the ship has crashed. [[Endure_Harm]] and [[Endure_Stress]]. [[Fulfill_Your_Vow]] to repair the vessel or procure a new one before you can [[Lift_Off]] again.
