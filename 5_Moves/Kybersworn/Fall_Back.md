# Fall Back

When **you attempt to escape from an ongoing conflict**, envision your action and roll. If you...

- Are already at range, or flee using your speed and the terrain to your advantage, roll +edge.
- Coordinate with others, or cover your allies as they fall back, roll +heart.
- Defend your escape route with courageous action, roll +iron.
- Use trickery or deceit to mask your trail, roll +shadow.
- Devise an optimal escape route, or organize transport, roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, you escape the chaos of battle and reach safety.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must also choose one.
- It's worse that you thought: [[Endure_Harm]].
- You are overcome: [[Endure_Stress]].
- You are followed: a foe pursues you, or an existing danger worsens.
- You suffer collateral damage: Something of value is lost or broken, or someone important must pay the cost.
- You'll pay for it: An objective or opportunity falls out of reach.
- Others won't forget: You are marked for vengeance.

On a **miss**, you are interrupted as you fall back. [[Pay_the_Price]].
