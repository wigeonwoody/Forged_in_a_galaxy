In Starforged, Bonds and Connections are important elements that help define your character's relationships with others and can influence the narrative and gameplay.

### Bonds and Connections in Starforged

**Connections:**
- **Definition:** Connections represent significant relationships your character has with NPCs. These can be allies, mentors, rivals, or any other meaningful relationship.
- **Creation:** You create a Connection when you meet someone important to your story. This usually involves a scene or interaction that establishes the relationship.
- **Details:** Each Connection has a name, a role, and a description of the relationship. You also assign a rank to the Connection, which reflects the strength and importance of the bond (e.g., Troublesome, Dangerous, Formidable, etc.).
- **Development:** As you interact with a Connection, you can strengthen or weaken the bond based on your actions and the outcomes of your interactions.

**Bonds:**
- **Definition:** Bonds are a measure of the strength and depth of your Connections. They represent trust, loyalty, and shared experiences.
- **Mechanics:** Bonds can provide mechanical benefits, such as bonuses to certain moves when the Connection is involved. They can also influence narrative outcomes.
- **Progress:** You can mark progress on a Bond track as you deepen your relationship with a Connection. This can lead to narrative rewards or advantages in the game.

## Example
### Establishing a Connection with Master Alara Ven

Given that Master Alara Ven is a significant figure in Roga Danar's journey, it makes sense to establish a Connection with her. Here's how you might do it:

1. **Name:** Master Alara Ven
2. **Role:** Mentor and Jedi Master
3. **Description:** Master Alara Ven is a wise and balanced Jedi, guiding Roga Danar on his path to redemption and self-discovery. She represents the light and discipline of the Jedi Order.
4. **Rank:** Formidable (as a mentor, her influence and importance in Roga's life are significant)

## How to use...

In Starforged, Connection moves can be made both during gameplay and during the "housekeeping" phase at the end of a session. Here's how you might approach it:

### During Gameplay:
- **When to Use:** If a significant interaction or event occurs with a Connection during the session, you can make a Connection move on the spot. This helps capture the immediate impact of the interaction and can influence the narrative as it unfolds.
- **Example:** If Roga Danar has a meaningful conversation with Master Alara Ven that deepens their relationship, you might choose to make a Connection move right then to reflect that change.

### During Housekeeping:
- **When to Use:** At the end of a session, during the housekeeping phase, you can review your interactions and decide if any Connections have evolved. This is a good time to reflect on the session as a whole and make any necessary adjustments to your Bonds and Connections.
- **Example:** After a session, you might realize that Roga's relationship with Master Ven has grown significantly, prompting you to mark progress on the Bond track.

### Recommendation:
- **Balance Both Approaches:** Use Connection moves during gameplay for immediate, impactful interactions, and during housekeeping for a more reflective, comprehensive update on your character's relationships. This ensures that your Connections evolve naturally and meaningfully over time.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your play style and how you prefer to integrate narrative and mechanics. Let me know if you'd like to establish or update any Connections now, or if you have any other questions!
