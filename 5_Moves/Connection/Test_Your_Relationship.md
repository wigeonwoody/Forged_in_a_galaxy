# Test Your Relationship

**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](Develop_Your_Relationship.md).

On a **weak hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](Develop_Your_Relationship.md), but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.

  * Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and [Pay the Price](Pay_the_Price.md).
  * Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Swear_an_Iron_Vow.md) (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail the quest, the connection is permanently undone.
