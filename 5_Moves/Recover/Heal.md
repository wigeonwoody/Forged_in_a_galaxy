# Heal

**When you receive medical care or provide treatment**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

  * Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
  * Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
  * Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
  * Provide care: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-2) or [Sacrifice Resources](Sacrifice_Resources.md) (-2).

On a **miss**, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Pay_the_Price.md).
