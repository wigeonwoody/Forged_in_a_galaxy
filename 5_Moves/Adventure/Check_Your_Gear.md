# Check Your Gear

**When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you have it, but must choose one.

  * Your supply is diminished: [Sacrifice Resources](Sacrifice_Resources.md) (-1)
  * It's not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-2)

On a **miss**, you don't have it and the situation grows more perilous. [Pay the Price](Pay_the_Price.md).
