markprogress {either the filename that contains the progress track or use the one-word references of Bonds, Discoveries, or Quests} {times to mark progress} {optional: Which character filename?} - For this to know which character stat to use, make sure to use the EXACT file name of the character in the Character folder which can include letters, numbers, and underscore. If left out, it defaults to the first file name in the Character folder.  The number of times to mark progress will typically be only 1 or 2 (unless a strong hit takes you to 3 or something).  You don't need to calculate the number of ticks to mark UNLESS you are marking on Bonds, Discoveries, or Quests.  For example, on a Dangerous track if you want to mark progress once, just use the number 1.  It will calculate that one progress means 8 ticks (or two boxes) on its own.  However, on Bonds, if you wanted to mark 2 boxes, you would need to input 8 for the 8 tick marks necessary to get 2 boxes.
