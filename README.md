## Modifying/adding files in 'Forged in a galaxy'
You will need the following tools.
- Obsidian
- git

How to modify Forged in a galaxy.
1. Create a new branch from 'main'. Name it the task you're going to do. (i.e. installing_plugins, adding_Force_attribute, updating_copilot)
2. Check-out the new branch
3. Make your changes and test the changes.
5. Add the files that you have changed to the 'staged' commit.
6. Commit the changes with a comment.
7. Push the changes to github.com
8. Merge the changes into the main branch.
9. Delete the new branch.

## Fonts
For the headings, I'm using [Xolonium font](https://www.fontspace.com/xolonium-font-f17644) and [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) as the interface font.

## Plugins
This vault only works with the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater), and most importantly: [Inline Scripts](https://github.com/jon-heard/obsidian-inline-scripts) plugins. I have included Copilot, Git (for backup), and Advanced Tables.

## CSS Snippet
The `snippets.css` file contains all the folder icons, color coding of new callout boxes, title and header fonts, fixing the tasks so they don't strike through when marked, and an inversion code so that the SVG files will invert black/white based on light/dark mode.

## Credits
All original Assets, Moves, and Oracles are from [Dataforged](https://github.com/rsek/dataforged), the official Starforged repository. Starsmith: Expanded Oracles, Starsmith: Mecha Merc assets, and Starsmith: Assets are my original works (available in PDF and print form on [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com).)
Star Wars related assets and moves came from the Kybersworn project and Lightside project.

Image, Map, and Stethoscope icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)

All other icons from [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net) by Delapouite, et. al.
