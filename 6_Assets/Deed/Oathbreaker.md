### Deed


## Abilities:
- [ ] This asset counts as an impact. One time only, when you [Swear an Iron Vow](Swear_an_Iron_Vow.md) (extreme or greater) to redeem yourself, give that vow a special mark. When you [Reach a Milestone](Reach_a_Milestone.md) on the marked vow, take +2 momentum. If you [Forsake Your Vow](Forsake_Your_Vow.md) on the quest, discard this asset and retain the impact.

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](5_Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage.md) or [Compel](Compel.md) by reaffirming your commitment to your marked vow, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Fulfill_Your_Vow.md) on the marked quest and score a hit, you find redemption and automatically gain this ability at no cost. You may then improve one of your stats by +1 and discard this asset. Once the asset is discarded, you may not take it again.
