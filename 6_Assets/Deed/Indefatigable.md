# Indefatigable
### Deed


## Abilities:
Once you have cleared indebtedâ€¦

- [ ] When you use your status as a rough and tough survivor to [Compel](Compel.md) people who know of your previous ship&#x27;s destruction, boost.

- [ ] When you [Sojourn](Sojourn.md) and score a hit, you may regale the local community with the story of how you lost your previous ship. If you do, choose one:
     * Revel in your tenacity: Take +2 momentum.
     * Leverage your status: [Gather Information](Gather_Information.md) +heart (instead of +wits).

- [ ] When you [Withstand Damage](Withstand_Damage.md), roll with advantage. Then, if you score a strong hit and choose to ride it out, take +2 momentum (instead of +1).
