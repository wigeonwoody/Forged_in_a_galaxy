# Traveler
### Deed


## Abilities:
Once you have returned from an alternate reality or timeline touched by the chaotic energy of the multiverseâ€¦

- [ ] When you overcome a miss by shuffling through realities and calling forth one where you succeed, improve the result to a strong hit. Then, fill one segment of a six-segment clock representing stress on reality. When the clock is filled, a localized crack in the multiverse forms. Envision the dire consequences and reset the clock.

- [ ] When you search the timeline for possible futures, enact the first ability of the Seer path asset.

- [ ] When you create a link to the current point in time, enact the second ability on the Looper path asset but add options for the time gap of +1 if weeks, +0 if months, and -1 if years.
