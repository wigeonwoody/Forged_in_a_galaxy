# Sensor Array
### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] Your advanced sensors scan the paths ahead to help spot dangers. When you [Undertake an Expedition](Undertake_an_Expedition.md) (+wits), you may reroll one challenge die.

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](5_Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage.md) or [Gather Information](Gather_Information.md) by scanning your vehicle's surroundings or analyzing a nearby object, choose one and take +1 momentum on a hit.

 * Manual scan: Add +1
 * Automated scan: Instead of rolling the action die, make it the value of your vehicle's integrity

- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Enter_the_Fray.md) against an ambush, or [Face Danger](5_Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger.md) to detect a hidden threat, you may roll +integrity. If you do, reroll any dice and take +1 momentum on a hit.
