# Grappler
### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] Your grappler can disrupt systems and snare machines and vehicles with a magnetic tether. When you take a minute or so to ready the grappler, roll +integrity or +wits. On a strong hit, the grappler is charged and may be fired. On a weak hit, charging requires extra time or focus; [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-1). On a miss, charging fails and you must [Withstand Damage](Withstand_Damage.md) (-2). If you make a move to attack a foe or overcome an obstacle by firing the grappler, take an automatic strong hit.

- [ ] If you score a strong hit when readying the grappler, you may [Sacrifice Resources](Sacrifice_Resources.md) (-1) to overcharge the module. When you fire an overcharged grappler, take +2 momentum; if in a fight, also mark progress.

- [ ] When you [Take Decisive Action](Take_Decisive_Action.md) by firing the grappler, you may reroll one challenge die.
