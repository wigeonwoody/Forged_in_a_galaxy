### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] Your vehicle is rigged for silent running. When you make a move against a specific foe or threat to avoid detection, add +1. If you [Enter the Fray](Enter_the_Fray.md) by ambushing an unaware foe, add +1 and mark progress on a strong hit.

- [ ] When you travel stealthily as you [Undertake an Expedition](Undertake_an_Expedition.md) (+shadow), you may reroll your action die.

- [ ] When you are poised to [Strike](Strike.md) from hiding, you may roll +shadow. If you do, choose one (before rolling).

 * Strike true: Reroll any dice.
 * Strike hard: Mark progress on a hit.

On a strong hit with a match, you also remain totally undetected; take +2 momentum and add +1 on your next [Strike](Strike.md).
