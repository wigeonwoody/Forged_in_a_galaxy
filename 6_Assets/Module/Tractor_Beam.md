# Tractor Beam
### Module


## Abilities:


- [ ] Your tractor beam can tow a smaller vehicle, asteroid or other willing object. When you make a move with the tractor beam, take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] As above, but add +1 to the move as the beam splits into several smaller beams for finer manipulation of smaller objects.

- [ ] When you take a minute or so to invert the polarity of your tractor beam and charge it, roll +integrity or +wits. On a hit, the beam is reversed and charged, and it may be released in a single blast. On a weak hit, as above, but it takes time. [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-1). On a miss, the charge fails and you must [Withstand Damage](Withstand_Damage.md) (-2). If you make a move to push a foe or obstacle away by releasing the charge, take an automatic strong hit.


## Condition:
- [ ] Charged
