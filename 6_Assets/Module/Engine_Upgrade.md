### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] Your vehicleâ€™s finely-tuned engines speed your travels. When you [Undertake an Expedition](Undertake_an_Expedition.md) (+edge) and score a strong hit, take +1 momentum; on a strong hit with a 6 on your action die, take +2 momentum instead of +1.

- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Enter_the_Fray.md), choose one (before rolling).

 * Maneuver: Add +1 and take +1 momentum on a strong hit.
 * Boost: Take +2 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you make a desperate move to pursue a foe, escape a threat, or get in range, you may push your engines to their limit. If you do (decide after rolling), reroll any dice and count a weak hit as a strong hit. Then, [Withstand Damage](Withstand_Damage.md) (-2).
