## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Swear_an_Iron_Vow.md) to resolve a dispute, negotiate an agreement, or gather support, add +1. On a strong hit, mark progress on the quest. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Fulfill_Your_Vow.md) on a diplomatic mission (formidable or greater) and score a hit, also mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track.

- [ ] When you make a move to defuse, reason, or negotiate, add +1. On a miss, you may take a different tack. Envision this new approach, reroll all dice, and add +2. If you score a miss yet again, face a dire complication or blow to your reputation as you [Pay the Price](Pay_the_Price.md).

- [ ] When you [Make a Connection](Make_a_Connection.md) or [Sojourn](Sojourn.md), add +1. If you [Sojourn](Sojourn.md) and score a strong hit with a match, you are shown great kindness or respect; take +2 momentum or make an extra recover move with an automatic strong hit.
