# Armored
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Face Danger](5_Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger.md), [React Under Fire](React_Under_Fire.md), or [Clash](Clash.md) against physical attacks or impact, you may put trust in your armorâ€™s strength. If you do, preset your action die to 4. On a strong hit with a match, take +2 momentum as you build confidence, make an impression on your foes, or improve your position.

- [ ] You add an important new piece to your set of armor, or upgrade its materials. As above, but preset your action die to 5 instead of 4.

- [ ] When you must [Endure Harm](Endure_Harm.md), you may instead let your armor take the hit. If you do, roll your action die. On a 4 or greater, ignore the harm. On a 1-3, ignore the harm but your armor is now broken; you must [Repair](Repair.md) and spend 5 repair points to bring it back to working condition.
