# Precog
### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] You can see brief moments into the future allowing you to attempt avoiding mistakes. When you score a miss on [Face Danger](5_Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger.md), [Clash](Clash.md) or [React Under Fire](React_Under_Fire.md), you may choose for this to have been a vision of an avoidable future. If you do, [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-2), envision how you approach the situation differently and reroll any dice. On a strong hit, take +1 momentum.

- [ ] As above, but it can be used when you score a miss on [Enter the Fray](Enter_the_Fray.md), [Strike](Strike.md) or [Gain Ground](Gain_Ground.md).

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](5_Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage.md) with your precognitive ability, [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-2) and make the hit options add +2 and take +1 momentum instead of the normal options.
