# Sleuth
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Swear_an_Iron_Vow.md) to solve a murder, disappearance, theft, or other mystery, make the rank of the quest no greater than formidable. Then, when you [Gather Information](Gather_Information.md) in the course of the investigation, roll three challenge dice and choose two. If any challenge dice match, you must use those values. On a miss with a match, envision what you learn of a deepening conspiracy or betrayal, make the rank of your quest one higher (no greater than epic), and use the new rank when marking future progress.

- [ ] When you make a move to avoid detection as you put a person or place under surveillance, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [Make a Connection](Make_a_Connection.md) with a potential informant, you may (instead of rolling) take an automatic weak hit.
