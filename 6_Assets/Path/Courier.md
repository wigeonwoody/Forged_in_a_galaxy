### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Swear_an_Iron_Vow.md) to transport and protect something precious, set its safety to 5. When you [Undertake an Expedition](Undertake_an_Expedition.md) or [Set a Course](Set_a_Course.md) and score a weak hit or miss, you may suffer -1 safety as the cost. On a miss with a match, you must suffer -2 safety as the cost. When safety falls to 0, envision a major complication related to this mission. If you overcome the threat, mark progress twice on this quest. Then, set safety to 3.

- [ ] When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Fulfill_Your_Vow.md) to an unbonded connection by completing a courier mission, mark progress twice on the relationship.

- [ ] When you [Sojourn](Sojourn.md) during a courier mission, you may roll +safety. On a strong hit, take +1 safety or +1 momentum.
