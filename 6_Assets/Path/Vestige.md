## Abilities:
- [ ] You are all that remains of a people, culture, or tradition. When you [Face Death](Face_Death.md) or [Face Desolation](Face_Desolation.md), visions of your heritage give you the strength to carry on. Envision how this manifests, and reroll any dice. On a strong hit with a match, a surprising new aspect of your heritage is revealed; take +2 momentum and mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track.

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](5_Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage.md) or [Compel](Compel.md) through a tale, performance, or ceremony, envision what you reveal of your heritage. Then, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] You carry a physical relic of your heritage. Envision its powers or nature. When you make a move directly aided by the relic and score a miss, you may reroll your action die.
