# Mercenary
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you agree to wage war or defend others from war in exchange for payment or promises, you may [Swear an Iron Vow](Swear_an_Iron_Vow.md) to see the mission done. If you do, reroll any dice. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Fulfill_Your_Vow.md), make the legacy reward one rank higher (1 extra box if already epic).

- [ ] When you [Make a Connection](Make_a_Connection.md) by searching out or making contact with someone in need of your services, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, this mission pits you against an unresolved aspect of your past or a hated foe; mark 2 ticks on your quests legacy track.

- [ ] When you [Check Your Gear](Check_Your_Gear.md) in the midst of a fight, or [Resupply](Resupply.md) by looting the field of battle in the aftermath of a fight, add +2.
