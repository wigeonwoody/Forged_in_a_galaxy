# Kinetic
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] You wield kinetic powers. By focusing, you may remotely push, pull, lift, or constrict objects and beings that are about your size or smaller. When you are in a risky situation and draw on your powers to make a move, add +2 and [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-2).

- [ ] As above, but you may instead draw on your powers in a desperate effort to change the outcome of an action. If you do, add +2 (after you roll) and [Lose Momentum](Lose_Momentum.md) (-3).

- [ ] When your momentum is at its max, you may attempt great kinetic feats, such as manipulating large objects and creating destructive bursts of concussive force. To do so, reset momentum. Then, as you make a single move fueled by your powers, take an automatic strong hit. If you are in a fight, mark progress.
