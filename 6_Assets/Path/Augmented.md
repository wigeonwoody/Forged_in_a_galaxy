# Augmented
### Path
### Augment 1:
<hr>
### Augment 2:
<hr>

## Abilities:
- [ ] You are equipped with an advanced prosthetic, implant, or mechanical enhancement. When you make a move directly aided by the augment, envision how it gives you exceptional capabilities and add +1. On a strong hit with a match, your augment exceeds expectations; take +2 momentum. On a miss with a match, the augment is broken; you must [Repair](Repair.md) and spend 3 repair points to bring it back to working condition.

- [ ] You are equipped with a second augment. It functions as above, but the benefits of the two augments do not stack.

- [ ] When you must [Endure Harm](Endure_Harm.md) or [Face Death](Face_Death.md), you may instead mark an augment as broken. [Repair](Repair.md) it as detailed above.
