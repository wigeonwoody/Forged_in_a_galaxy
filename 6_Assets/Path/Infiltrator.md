# Infiltrator
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you make a move to break into a secure site, infiltrate a protected area, or hack or manipulate a secure system, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, access is easier than expected; take another +1 momentum.

- [ ] When you [Face Danger](5_Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger.md) or [Secure an Advantage](5_Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage.md) to establish a false identity, add +1. On a hit, you may add +1 when using that identity to deceive or influence others. If you score a miss with a match when using that identity, your deception is completely and dramatically undone.

- [ ] When you [Check Your Gear](Check_Your_Gear.md) for a device with a specific function to aid in infiltration, espionage, or sabotage, add +1. On a hit, reroll any dice the first time you make a move aided by the device.
