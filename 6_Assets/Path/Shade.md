# Shade
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] Drawing on esoteric energies, you may instantly cloak your form in the shadowy veil of the void. When you are veiled and make a move to ambush, hide, or sneak, you may preset your action die to 5. In darkness, make it 6. On a miss, in addition to any other cost, you are revealed and canâ€™t veil yourself again until the current situation is resolved.

- [ ] When you expand your veil to immerse your surroundings in darkness, roll +shadow. On a strong hit, the darkness extends to all adjacent spaces. On a weak hit, only your immediate surroundings are made dark. On a miss, you fail and draw unwanted attention.

- [ ] When you intentionally drop your veil to reveal yourself for dramatic or surprising effect, foregoing its further use in this situation, take +2 momentum.
