## Abilities:


- [ ] Your crew member has a specific role aboard your command vehicle. When you make a move directly aided by their expertise, reroll your action die if its value is less than your crew member&#x27;s health. If you then score a strong hit with a match, mark 1 tick on your bonds legacy track.

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](5_Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage.md) or [Gather Information](Gather_Information.md) by conferencing with your crew member, add +1 for each crew member present (up to +4). On a miss, envision how friction arises between crew members.

- [ ] When your crew member is at full health and you score a miss with a match while they are present, you may set their health to 0 and mark them as out of action.  If you do, treat the miss with a match as a strong hit.
