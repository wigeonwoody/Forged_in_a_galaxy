# Banshee
### Companion
### Name:
<hr>

## Abilities:
- [ ] Your banshee companion accompanies you on planetside missions, using its echolocation to help guide the way. When you ride your banshee as you [Undertake an Expedition](Undertake_an_Expedition.md) or [Set a Course](Set_a_Course.md), you may roll +its health.

- [ ] When you make a move astride the banshee to detect a threat or avoid a fight, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, you're gone in a flash; take another +1 momentum.
