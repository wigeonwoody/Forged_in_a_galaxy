When you make a move by sending it to perform trickery (such as creating a distraction, sneaking into a protected location, or stealing an object) add +its health.

- [ ] You are attuned to the resonance of the sprite's crystalline structure, and can communicate with it at a distance and perceive through its senses. When you [Secure an Advantage](5_Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage.md) by observing a situation from its perspective, or remotely [Gather Information](Gather_Information.md), add +its health.
