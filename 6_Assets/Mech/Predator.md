### Mech

### Name:<hr>

## Abilities:


- [ ] When you are cloaked and make a move against a specific foe or threat to avoid detection, you may preset your action die to the Predator&#x27;s integrity.  If utilizing cover, make it one more (up to six).

- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Enter_the_Fray.md) while cloaked, add +1 and mark progress on a strong hit.

- [ ] When you [Strike](Strike.md) while cloaked, you may roll +shadow.  If you do, choose one (before rolling):
  * Strike true: Reroll any dice.
  * Strike hard: Mark progress on a hit.
On a strong hit with a match, you also remain totally undetected; take +2 momentum and add +1 if your next move is a [Strike](Strike.md).
