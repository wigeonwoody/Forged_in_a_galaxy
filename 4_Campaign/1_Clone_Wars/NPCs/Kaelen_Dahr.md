# Master Kaelen Dahr

Species: Human
Gender: Male
Age: Early 50s
Appearance: Master Kaelen Dahr has a tall, imposing figure, with sharp features that seem to mirror his intense personality. His eyes are a piercing shade of green, once full of wisdom and compassion, now shadowed with a hint of bitterness and intensity. His hair, a dark brown with streaks of gray, is pulled back into a severe ponytail, giving him a disciplined appearance. Kaelen's face bears a few scars, remnants of battles fought long ago, and his expression often carries a stern, calculating look. He wears a simple yet practical Jedi robe, though the colors have darkened over time, reflecting his fall from the path of light.

Personality:

Master Kaelen Dahr was once known for his strict adherence to discipline and a belief in the power of the Force as a tool to impose order and control. He was a brilliant strategist and a talented warrior, capable of great feats of lightsaber combat and Force manipulation. His methods were always more direct and forceful than most Jedi, believing that swift, decisive action was the key to maintaining peace in the galaxy.

Kaelen’s downfall began when he became frustrated with the slow bureaucracy of the Jedi Council and their cautious approach in the face of galactic conflicts. He believed that the Jedi Order was too restrained and that greater strength was needed to confront the threats looming in the galaxy. This belief led him to explore darker aspects of the Force, using his emotions as a way to tap into more potent powers.

His teachings to Roga often emphasized control over emotion, but in a way that encouraged using one's feelings to fuel strength rather than to find peace. He valued power and the ability to influence outcomes directly, seeing hesitation as a weakness. As Kaelen grew more obsessed with the pursuit of control, he started straying from the Jedi Code, ultimately leading to his banishment from the Order.

Fall from Grace:

Master Kaelen Dahr's turn to the Dark Side wasn’t immediate. It was a gradual process, fueled by his disillusionment with the Jedi Order’s politics and what he saw as their failure to act decisively against the growing darkness in the galaxy. He began using his knowledge of the Force to manipulate outcomes in ways that bordered on coercion, justifying his actions as necessary for the greater good.

The breaking point came when Kaelen was discovered using forbidden techniques to dominate the minds of others, bending their wills to his own. The Jedi Council confronted him, and despite their attempts to bring him back to the Light, Kaelen refused to abandon his new path. He was stripped of his rank and exiled from the Order, leaving behind a legacy of betrayal and a student in Roga who had been influenced by his teachings.

Influence on Roga Danar:

Kaelen’s teachings left a deep mark on Roga, planting seeds of doubt about the Jedi way. He taught Roga to harness his emotions, to not be afraid of using them as a source of power. Though Roga tried to remain true to the Jedi Code, the echoes of Kaelen’s philosophy still haunt him, especially during moments of frustration or when faced with difficult decisions.

Kaelen Dahr’s shadow looms large over Roga’s current training with Master Alara Ven, as Roga struggles to reconcile his past with the path of the Light Side of the Force. Master Alara's calm and patient methods are a stark contrast to Kaelen's aggressive and uncompromising teachings, creating an internal conflict that Roga must overcome.

Current Status:

Kaelen Dahr’s whereabouts are unknown following his banishment. Rumors circulate that he has become a rogue Force user, operating in the shadows and seeking to grow his power further away from the prying eyes of the Jedi Order. Some say he has aligned himself with dark forces or criminal syndicates that share his vision of order through power. His name is now whispered with caution among the Jedi, a reminder of the thin line between light and darkness.
