# Religion
 - [ ] **1-33**  **Our gods failed us. We left them behind.** 
 
The Exodus was a tipping point. The gods offered no help to the billions who died in the cataclysm, and spirituality has little meaning in the Forge. Most now see religion as a useless relic of our past. But the search for meaning continues, and many are all-too-willing to follow a charismatic leader who claims to offer a better way.

*Quest Starter: A charismatic leader claims to have harnessed a technology that offers new hope to the people of the Forge. What is this innovation? What is your relationship to this person or their followers? What grave danger do they pose?*

- [ ]  **34-67**  **Our faith is as diverse as our people.** 
 
Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordialsâ€”gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.

*Quest Starter: A cult seeks to take control of a site reputed to hold a Primordial artifact. What holy object do they seek? Why are you sworn to stop them?*

- [ ]  **68-100**  **Three dominant religious orders, the Triumvirate, battle for influence and power within the Forge.** 
 
Our communities are often sworn to serve one of the three doctrines of the Triumvirate. For many, faith offers purpose and meaning. But it also divides us. Throughout our brief history in the Forge, the leaders of the Triumvirate have pitted us against one another. For this reason, some are apostates who disavow these religions and follow a different path.

*Quest Starter: You bear the mark of one of the gods of the Triumvirate. What is it? Priests declare this as a sign you are chosen to fulfill a destiny. Do you accept this fate, and swear to see it through, or are you determined to see it undone? What force opposes you?*
