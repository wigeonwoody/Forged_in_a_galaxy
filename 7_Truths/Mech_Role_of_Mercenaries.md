# Role of Mercenaries (Mech)
 - [ ] **1-33**  **Mech pilot mercenaries are generally viewed as loners out to get paid. They are equal parts feared and respected because they are unconcerned with the law.**

Building a mech is a labor of love because of how unique each one is which makes it difficult to repair and maintain them. Every piece of the machine is custom built and takes a skilled mechanic or engineer to design, test, and install. 

*Suggested Asset: Bounty Hunter, Mercenary, or Wealth Management*

- [ ]  **34-66**  **Mercenaries operate in independent groups with a handful of mechs. Because governments like to contract groups themselves, they are given wide latitude when it comes to the law.**
 
Some of the mecha mercs go to the highest bidder but other groups only take on jobs that fit their ideology. Like-minded individuals tend to draw together behind a leader who exemplifies their world views.

*Suggested Asset: Bannersworn or Leader*

- [ ]  **67-100**  **Mercenaries are nominally under the control and jurisdiction of powerful factions. Licenses for mech operation and components are required.**

Faction mercenaries are known for abusing their power whenever possible. This had led some mecha mercs to "go private" which technically makes them outlaws in the eyes of the factions. Hunted by their previous employers, lone mercenaries are rare and secretive, but equally rare are those mercs still under the umbrella of a faction who put people over profits. 

*Suggested Asset: Fugitive or a faction-issued Companion asset that is a Bot.*
