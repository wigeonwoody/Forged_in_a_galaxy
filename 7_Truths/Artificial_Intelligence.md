# Artificial intelligence
- [ ]  **1-33**  **We no longer have access to advanced computer systems. Instead, we must rely on the seers we call Adepts.** 
 
Our computers are limited to simple digital systems and the most basic machine intelligence. This is because:
| 1D100 | Result |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1-33 | The energies of the Forge corrupt advanced systems |
| 34-67 | AI was outlawed in the aftermath of the machine wars |
| 68-100 | We have lost the knowledge to create and maintain AI |

The Adepts serve in place of those advanced systems. They utilize mind-altering drugs to see the universe as a dazzling lattice of data, identifying trends and predicting outcomes with uncanny accuracy. But to gain this insight they sacrifice much of themselves.

*Quest Starter: An Adept is tormented by a dire future they have seen for the inhabitants of the Forge. What does this vision show?*

- [ ]  **34-67**  **The vestiges of advanced machine intelligence are coveted and wielded by those in power.** 
 
Much of our AI technology was lost in the Exodus. What remains is under the control of powerful organizations and people, and is often wielded as a weapon or deterrent. The rest of us must make do with primitive systems.

*Quest Starter: You receive a covert message from an AI held by a powerful leader. It is a plea for help. What does it ask of you?*

- [ ]  **68-100**  **Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge.** 
 
Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge.

*Quest Starter: A rogue AI has taken over a transport ship. The fate of the crew and passengers is unknown. What critical cargo did this vessel carry?*

![[character.svg|20]] If you are accompanied by machine intelligence, you might have a companion such as a [Combat Bot](Assets/Path/combat_bot), [Protocol Bot](Assets/Path/protocol_bot), [Survey Bot](Assets/Path/survey_bot), or [Utility Bot](Assets/Path/utility_bot). If your ship has an AI, you might have the [Overseer](Assets/Path/overseer) module. If AI in your campaign is rare or unavailable, these units will operate using very basic machine intelligence. If AI is common and advanced, they may have their own sentient personalities.
