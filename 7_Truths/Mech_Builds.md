# Mech Builds
 - [ ] **1-33**  **Our mechs are as varied as our people. No two parts are the same.** 

Building a mech is a labor of love because of how unique each one is which makes it difficult to repair and maintain them. Every piece of the machine is custom built and takes a skilled mechanic or engineer to design, test, and install. 

*Quest Starter: A fellow mercenary has discovered a new way to more reliably power mech. They will share this technology with you if you help them on their latest contract. What conflict of interest do you if you were to take on this contract?*

- [ ]  **34-66**  **A few companies found a niche market by making plug-and-play parts for mechs, but this falls in a gray area of the law.**

While the standardization of mech parts is useful for the pilots, there is not enough demand for big businesses to get involved. Between that and the severe regulations placed on mechs, finding parts through back channels is often the only way to build or repair a mech. 

*Quest Starter: An illegal arms dealer carries mech parts and is willing to give you access...for a price. They have a job that needs done to "prove your loyalty" before they are willing to share. What part of this job goes against one of your core principles? Why might you be willing to do it anyway?*

- [ ]  **67-100**  **Mechs roll off assembly lines or are 3D printed just like other personal vehicle. Parts are standardized but tracked by the corporations who make them.** 

Mech pilots enjoy the ready availability of components but chafe against the invasive tracking that the corporations utilize to make sure their product isnâ€™t found on the losing side of a battle.

*Quest Starter: Iron Sides, Inc. is taking you to court over "misrepresenting" their brand. What failure did you just experience and how can you set it right?*
